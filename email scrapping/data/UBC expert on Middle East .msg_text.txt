Hi Kurt and Thandi 

Hope you're doing well. I'm doing a story about the comments from Minister Selina Robinson referring to pre-1948 Palestine as "a crappy piece of land with nothing on it." 

Is there a UBC prof who could weigh in on the history of Israel and Palestinian relations and why this comment is so painful for many? 

My cell is 250-507-2660 and my deadline is 3:30 today. 

Thank you

Katie
