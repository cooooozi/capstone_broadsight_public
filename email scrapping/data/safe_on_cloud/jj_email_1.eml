Hello Kurt and Andrea,

We have an upcoming paper about to be published that will be something the
media might be interested in. I've worked with you both before, so thought
I'd reach out re next steps, but please let me know if there is someone
else I should be contacting.

The paper will be published in *JAMA Network Open, *which is a pretty good
medical journal. It's embargoed until February 27th.

The work is on predicting the survival of cancer patients using a branch of
artificial intelligence called natural language processing, the same stuff
that everyone now knows about thanks to ChatGPT. We use the AI (language
models) to predict how long a cancer patient will survive based on the
first consultation report their medical oncologists writes after their
initial appointment. This is a particularly exciting technique because all
cancer patients would have this document, so this prediction is accessible.
Our work was able to predict survival quite accurately, similar to prior
work that has had to use fancy stuff like tumour genetic markers to make
these predictions.

I thought the media might be interested, but totally no problem if you
think not. If you do, please let me know next steps, what you'd suggest,
and the like. I'm very new to anything having to do with media relations :)

Best,

John-Jose
