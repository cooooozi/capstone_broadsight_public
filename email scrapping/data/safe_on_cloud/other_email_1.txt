[CAUTION: Non-UBC Email]

 

Good morning,

 

I’ve been assigned to do a story checking in on the Middle East-related protest camp at UBC.

 

I’ll be heading there around 10:30 — would it be possible to interview someone with the university about where things stand/where things are going on this at some point this morning or afternoon?

 

Thanks for your help,

 

Martin MacMahon
