Subject: Op-ed media contacts for CBC, Globe and Mail, etc. 
Message Body: Hello





We're UBC faculty researchers trying to pitch an op-ed on carbon pricing to an CBC or somewhere else. Do you have any direct contacts we could use? Or, any elsewhere? 





Cutting through the media firewall would be helpful. 





Many thanks,

Derek & Naoko
